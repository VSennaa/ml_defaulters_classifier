## 🚀 About

**Marketing Classification Models** is a machine learning project aimed at classifying and predicting investment intent based on customer data. Three models were tested in this project: decision tree, dummy, and KNN (with 5 neighbors).
## 📝 How to Use

To use the notebook, follow these steps:

```shell
# 1. Import the notebook (ipynb) into your environment

# 2. Load your dataset (CSV format), ensuring that the data normalization process is done for numerical features

# 3. Define the prediction input as a dictionary (the data for prediction should be in a similar format to the dataset)

# 4. Run the model prediction (using the trained models: Dummy, Decision Tree, or KNN)
#    The model will predict based on the new data, and you can check the results

```
